## Unlocking Multilingual Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs and LVLMs via Representation Engineering

### Evaluation code is released.

### Inference
When using MathVista for inference, use the field “cot_question” as the input text. When using MathVerse for inference, use the field “question_for_eval” as the input text. 

If you are using other datasets, please find the corresponding prompts in evaluation/MathVerse/eval/prompts.py, and prepend the appropriate prompt to the input question according to the **task type** and **language setting**.
